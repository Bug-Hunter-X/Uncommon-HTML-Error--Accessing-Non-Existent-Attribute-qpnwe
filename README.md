# Uncommon HTML Error: Accessing Non-Existent Attribute

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that arises when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on an element.  This usually manifests as a runtime error in the browser's JavaScript console.

The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, which tries to access a non-existent attribute. The `bugSolution.html` file offers a corrected version.  Always ensure attribute existence before access to prevent unexpected errors.
